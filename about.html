## About

I started my career in 2003, giving music and guitar classes. In 2007 I switched to the software industry and since then I've been working as a software developer, participating in many projects and acumulating experiences with various technologies. I'm a father, husband and in my spare time I still play some guitar and practice Karate.

Starting with music, I expanded my taste for arts in general, but specially for photography. The one you see in the background is the <a href="https://www.google.com.br/maps/place/99+E+Congress+Pkwy,+Chicago,+IL+60605,+USA" target="_blank">Michigan Avenue</a> in the night of August 27th, 2014.
