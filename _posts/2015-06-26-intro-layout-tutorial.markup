The intro part of the index page is consisted of three elements:

  1. Text
  2. Background image
  3. Your images

You can modify its text from the index.html file.
In order to set the background and your image, modify the following variables in _config:

<pre style="text-align: left">
background-img: "../img/intro-bg.jpg"
me-img: "/img/jetpacktocat.png"
</pre>

All set!
